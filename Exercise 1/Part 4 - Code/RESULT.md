Part 4 - Code implementation
============================

Implemented two threads that decrement and increment, the same shared recourse value (i) 100000 times. The ouput value is unpredictable, since the threads 
are incrementing/decrementing the same value/recourse concurrently. Implemented in C, Python and GO.
